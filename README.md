# Mission-Memory

Welcome to the Mission Memory Repo! This is my small personal project I started with a set of goals:
1. To store all the memories I had in my mission field
2. To practice my development skills and improve it
3. To have fun!

## What's this all about?

This is simply a side project while I continue my life as a recently returned missionary. I was given advice to record and store all my memories and make sure I could remember them when I need them the most. I thought of writing it in a journal, but that would be very time consuming. I also thought about an electronic copy, but that just would get lost in my files. 

And then one day, as I was walking back from my recent release as a missionary, I realized that I could make a website! That's right, I'l make a website! It's definitely better than writing on a journal, and it won't get easily lost because it's in a repository! I'll have to figure out how to build the database, but for now I'll just post it here!

## How's the progress?

You can check the commit notes and see where I am in my progress. For now, I'll make the code public and keep the files for now. My plan is to build a server at home and create a local site of some sorts to store my memories. It will then be digitally kept in a drive or in the cloud.
